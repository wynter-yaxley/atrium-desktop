// Stage Manager, after macOS's: the window in front stays on the stage, the others wait in a strip
// at the side of the screen, each on a card of its own (two windows of one app are two cards),
// standing at an angle in perspective, with its shadow and its app's icon, nothing behind them. A
// click there swaps the sets; Shift and a click brings a set onto the stage beside the one there,
// and the windows on the stage together go back to the strip as one set, to come back together. Activating a window any other way (the bar, Alt+Tab, a
// notification) changes the stage too.
//
// Waiting windows are minimized without activation: Windows' own state, so nothing is lost if
// Atrium goes away. A minimized window has no picture, so one is taken just before
// (ui/window_snapshot.h). The window then goes at once (its own minimize animation turned off) and
// its picture flies from where it was into its place in the strip; picked there, the picture flies
// back and the window comes up under it as it lands. Which windows Atrium put away is kept in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Atrium\stage.json,
// so that a restart picks them up again; turning Stage Manager off or quitting Atrium brings them
// all back.
//
// Only the selected desktop display is managed. Always shown, a window taking the stage over the
// strip's place moves beside it (so that the strip stays out); the strip steps aside while a window
// covers its place anyway (maximized, or put there), and comes out over it while the pointer rests on
// that edge. Auto-hidden, it only comes out that way.
